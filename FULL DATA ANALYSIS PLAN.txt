FULL DATA ANALYSIS PLAN (TAILORED TO THE DATA COLLECTED BY THE QUESTIONNAIRE)
This compares Rural vs Urban adolescent girls in:
•
Socio-demographic characteristics
•
Nutritional status (Anthropometrics)
•
Dietary patterns (Food Frequency Questionnaire)
•
Factors affecting diet
•
Dietary habits
Each section needs specific statistical treatment.
SECTION A — Socio-Demographic Characteristics
1. Variables
All variables here are categorical except “number of family members”.
Examples:
•
Residence (urban/rural)
•
Age groups
•
Living arrangement
•
Education level
•
Occupation of parents
•
Income
•
Religion
•
Ethnicity
2. Descriptive Statistics
Present:
•
Frequencies (n)
•
Percentages (%)
•
Pie/Bar charts
3. Comparative Analysis (Urban vs Rural)
I will Use:
Chi-square (χ²) test
To compare if socio-demographic factors significantly differ by location.
Examples:
•
Does parental occupation differ between rural and urban girls?
•
Is family income significantly different between groups?
•
Are girls in rural areas more likely to live with grandparents?
Why Chi-square? These are categorical variables — χ² is the correct test.
SECTION B — Anthropometry (Weight, Height, BMI)
1. Descriptive Statistics
For weight, height, BMI:
•
Mean ± SD
•
Minimum, maximum
•
BMI classification
o
Underweight
o
Normal
o
Overweight
o
Obese
2. Comparative Analysis
I will Use:
Independent t-test
Compare mean BMI between rural and urban girls.
Use:
Chi-square test
Compare prevalence of BMI categories.
3. Additional Nutritional Indicators
If possible:
•
Compute BMI-for-age Z-score (BAZ) using WHO charts
•
Classify:
o
Thinness
o
Normal
o
Overweight
o
Obesity
This boosts the academic quality of this project.
SECTION C — Dietary Assessment (Food Frequency Questionnaire)
Your FFQ includes:
•
Dairy
•
Tubers
•
Legumes
•
Cereals
•
Vegetables
•
Fruits
•
Meats
•
Snacks
•
Drinks
•
Spices
Each item has 6 frequency levels:
•
Daily
•
Once per week
•
2–3 times per week
•
4–6 times per week
•
Occasionally
•
Never
1. Cleaning and Coding
Assign numerical codes:
•
Daily = 6
•
4–6 times per week = 5
•
2–3 times per week = 4
•
Once per week = 3
•
Occasionally = 2
•
Never = 1
2. Descriptive Statistics
•
Percentage of girls consuming each food group at each frequency
•
Consumption patterns charts (cluster bar charts)
3. Comparative Analysis
Chi-square test
To compare frequency categories between rural and urban girls.
Examples:
•
Are fruits consumed more frequently in urban than rural girls?
•
Do rural girls consume tubers more often?
•
Are soft drinks more common among urban girls?
4. Dietary Diversity Score (Highly recommended)
I will create a Dietary Diversity Score (DDS) by counting how many food groups each respondent consumed at least "Once per week".
Then:
Use t-test
Compare DDS (diet quality) between rural and urban girls.
This adds scientific weight to your project.
SECTION D — Factors Affecting Dietary Habits
Variables include:
•
Food availability
•
Preferences
•
Culture
•
Socio-economic status
•
Nutritional knowledge
•
Geography
•
Peer influence
•
Cost of foods
•
Health status
•
Parents’ education
•
Seasons
Each is measured on:
•
Strongly Agree
•
Agree
•
Disagree
•
Strongly Disagree
1. Descriptive Statistics
•
Frequencies and percentages
•
Bar charts (Likert scale)
2. Comparative Analysis
Chi-square test
To compare differences between rural vs urban girls on:
•
Whether peer influence affects diet
•
Whether food cost impacts diet
•
Whether nutritional knowledge is a significant factor
•
Whether seasonality affects food consumption
3. Optional but powerful:
Spearman correlation
Check associations between diet-affecting factors and:
•
DDS (dietary diversity score)
•
BMI
Example:
•
Does socioeconomic status correlate with better diet?
•
Does nutritional knowledge relate to BMI?
SECTION E — Dietary Habits
Variables include:
•
Number of meals per day
•
Meal skipping
•
Meal skipped
•
Reasons for skipping
•
Sources of food
•
Eating-out frequency
•
Preference for snacks vs food
1. Descriptive Statistics
•
Percentages for meal patterns
•
Most common reasons for skipping meals
•
Most common food sources
•
Eating-out patterns
•
Snack preferences
2. Comparative Analysis
Chi-square test
For:
•
Meal skipping (rural vs urban)
•
Number of meals daily
•
Eating-out frequency
•
Preference for snacks
•
Reasons for meal skipping
Example comparisons:
•
Are urban girls more likely to eat out?
•
Do rural girls skip breakfast more?
•
Are snacks more preferred by urban girls?
