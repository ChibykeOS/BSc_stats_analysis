# CHAPTER FIVE: DISCUSSION, CONCLUSION, AND RECOMMENDATIONS

## 5.1 Discussion of Findings
This study set out to analyze and compare the nutritional status and dietary patterns of adolescent girls in rural and urban areas. The findings reveal significant disparities influenced by urbanization, socio-economic status, and lifestyle changes.

### 5.1.1 Socio-Demographic Characteristics
The study established a clear socio-economic divide between the two locations. Urban families reported significantly higher monthly incomes and higher parental education levels compared to rural families. This socio-economic advantage in urban areas is a double-edged sword; while it improves access to a diverse range of foods (as seen in the higher Dietary Diversity Score), it also facilitates the purchase of convenience and processed foods, contributing to the "nutrition transition" observed in this study. The rural population, characterized by lower income and agrarian occupations, faces challenges related to food access and variety.

### 5.1.2 Anthropometric Status
A key finding of this study is the statistically significant difference in Body Mass Index (BMI) between the two groups (p = 0.006). Urban adolescent girls had a higher mean BMI (22.30 kg/m²) compared to their rural counterparts (21.16 kg/m²). This finding aligns with the global trend where urbanization is associated with higher adiposity due to reduced physical activity and dietary changes. While the rural girls generally fell within the normal weight range, the urban data points towards an emerging risk of overweight and obesity, indicative of the "double burden of malnutrition" where undernutrition and overnutrition coexist, often shifting towards the latter in urbanizing populations.

### 5.1.3 Dietary Patterns
The Dietary Diversity Score (DDS) was significantly higher in the urban area (9.78 vs 9.44, p < 0.001), suggesting that urban girls consume a more varied diet. However, the Cluster Analysis provided a more nuanced view. It identified a "Modern/Affluent Diet" cluster dominated by urban girls (80.6%), characterized by high consumption of snacks, dairy, and fruits. Conversely, the "Limited Diet" cluster was predominantly rural (59.0%), reflecting a monotonous diet likely centered on staple tubers and cereals with limited protein and micronutrient sources. This suggests that while urban girls have diversity, it is partly driven by unhealthy processed foods, whereas rural girls struggle with overall dietary adequacy.

### 5.1.4 Factors Affecting Dietary Habits
The study identified "Peer Influence" and "Health Status" as significant factors affecting dietary choices. In the urban setting, peer influence appears to be a stronger driver, likely correlated with the school environment and social gatherings where snacking and eating out are common social activities. The significant impact of these factors highlights that dietary choices are not solely determined by hunger or availability but are deeply embedded in the social and cultural fabric of the adolescents' lives.

### 5.1.5 Dietary Habits
There were stark differences in eating habits. Urban girls exhibited behaviors typical of a "Westernized" lifestyle: higher frequency of eating out (p < 0.001), skipping meals (particularly breakfast), and a strong preference for snacks over main meals. These habits are major risk factors for diet-related non-communicable diseases. In contrast, rural girls maintained more traditional eating patterns with fewer meals eaten outside the home, though their meal frequency was significantly lower, possibly due to food insecurity or economic constraints.

## 5.2 Conclusion
This comparative study concludes that location (rural vs. urban) significantly influences the nutritional status and dietary patterns of adolescent girls.
1.  **Urbanization is linked to higher BMI**: Urban girls are heavier and at greater risk of overweight/obesity than rural girls.
2.  **Dietary Diversity vs. Quality**: While urban girls have higher dietary diversity, it is compromised by poor dietary habits such as frequent snacking and eating out. Rural girls face a different challenge of low dietary diversity and potential nutrient inadequacy.
3.  **Socio-economic Drivers**: Income and parental education are key determinants of these patterns, enabling food access in urban areas but limiting it in rural ones.

In summary, the nutritional profile of adolescent girls in this region is undergoing a transition. The urban population is shifting towards an energy-dense, processed diet, while the rural population remains vulnerable to dietary monotony and insufficiency.

## 5.3 Recommendations and Future Research

### 5.3.1 Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following recommendations are made:
1.  **Nutrition Education**: Comprehensive nutrition education programs should be implemented in secondary schools, focusing on the dangers of frequent snacking and skipping breakfast. This is particularly urgent for urban schools.
2.  **School Feeding Programs**: For rural areas, school feeding programs should be strengthened to supplement the "Limited Diet" identified, ensuring girls receive at least one diverse, nutrient-rich meal a day.
3.  **Parental Awareness**: Parents, especially in urban areas with higher income, need sensitization on the nutritional value of home-cooked meals versus fast food to curb the high rate of eating out.
4.  **Policy**: Government policies should aim to make healthy foods (fruits, vegetables, proteins) more affordable and accessible, particularly in rural markets where diversity is low.

### 5.3.2 Focus for Future Research
Subsequent research should focus on:
1.  **Micronutrient Status**: This study assessed dietary patterns; future studies should involve biochemical analysis (blood tests) to assess actual micronutrient deficiencies (e.g., Iron, Vitamin A) in these populations.
2.  **Physical Activity**: A detailed assessment of physical activity levels is needed to fully understand the contribution of sedentary lifestyles to the higher BMI observed in urban girls.
3.  **Longitudinal Studies**: Following a cohort of adolescents over time would help establish causal links between the identified dietary habits and long-term health outcomes in adulthood.
