# CHAPTER FOUR: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

## 4.1 Introduction
This chapter presents the results of the analysis of the nutritional status and dietary patterns of adolescent girls in rural and urban areas. The findings are organized into five main sections: socio-demographic characteristics, anthropometric status, dietary assessment, factors affecting dietary habits, and dietary habits. Advanced analysis including logistic regression and cluster analysis is also presented.

## 4.2 Socio-Demographic Characteristics
The study included a total of 367 adolescent girls, with 207 (56.4%) from urban areas and 160 (43.6%) from rural areas.

### 4.2.1 Comparison of Socio-Demographic Variables
Chi-square analysis revealed significant differences between rural and urban participants in several key socio-demographic variables:

*   **Living Arrangement (p < 0.001)**: There was a significant difference in living arrangements. Urban adolescents were more likely to live with both parents compared to their rural counterparts.
*   **Family Monthly Income (p < 0.001)**: Economic disparity was evident, with urban families reporting significantly higher monthly incomes compared to rural families.
*   **Parental Occupation**: Both father's occupation (p < 0.001) and mother's occupation (p = 0.015) differed significantly by residence, reflecting the different economic activities in the two settings (e.g., more civil servants/traders in urban vs. farmers/artisans in rural).
*   **Guardian Education (p = 0.019)**: The educational level of guardians also varied significantly, with urban guardians generally having higher educational attainment.

## 4.3 Anthropometric Status

### 4.3.1 Body Mass Index (BMI), Weight, and Height
Table 4.1 summarizes the mean anthropometric measurements for rural and urban adolescent girls.

**Table 4.1: Comparison of Mean Anthropometric Measurements**
| Variable | Rural Mean ± SD | Urban Mean ± SD | p-value | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Weight (kg) | 53.56 | 55.47 | 0.064 | Not Significant |
| Height (m) | 1.59 | 1.58 | 0.366 | Not Significant |
| **BMI (kg/m²)** | **21.16** | **22.30** | **0.006** | **Significant** |

The analysis showed that while there were no statistically significant differences in weight and height, **Urban adolescent girls had a significantly higher mean BMI (22.30 kg/m²) compared to rural girls (21.16 kg/m²) (p = 0.006)**. This suggests a trend towards higher body mass relative to height in the urban population.

### 4.3.2 BMI Categories
The prevalence of malnutrition (underweight, overweight, and obesity) was assessed. The distribution of BMI categories showed a borderline significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.051). The trend indicates a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity in the urban area, consistent with the "double burden of malnutrition" often observed in developing urban centers.

## 4.4 Dietary Assessment

### 4.4.1 Dietary Diversity Score (DDS)
The Dietary Diversity Score (DDS) was calculated based on the consumption of 10 food groups.

**Table 4.2: Comparison of Dietary Diversity Score**
| Group | Mean DDS | p-value | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Urban | 9.78 | **0.0002** | **Significantly Higher** |
| Rural | 9.44 | | |

Urban adolescent girls had a significantly higher mean Dietary Diversity Score (9.78) compared to rural girls (9.44) (p < 0.001). This indicates that urban girls consume a wider variety of food groups, likely due to better food access and availability in urban markets.

### 4.4.2 Dietary Patterns (Cluster Analysis)
Cluster analysis identified three distinct dietary patterns among the population:

1.  **Cluster 1 "Modern/Affluent Diet" (17.3%)**: Characterized by high consumption of all food groups, particularly Snacks (4.35), Dairy (4.29), and Fruits. This cluster is predominantly **Urban (80.6%)**, reflecting a diet rich in variety but also high in processed foods.
2.  **Cluster 2 "Limited Diet" (21.7%)**: Characterized by the lowest consumption frequency across all food groups. This cluster is predominantly **Rural (59.0%)**, indicating potential food insecurity or limited access to diverse foods.
3.  **Cluster 3 "Average/Mixed Diet" (61.0%)**: The largest group with moderate consumption of all food groups. It is fairly balanced but slightly more Urban (56.6%).

## 4.5 Factors Affecting Dietary Habits
Several factors were identified as significantly influencing the dietary choices of the adolescents:

*   **Peer Influence (p = 0.032)**: Peer pressure and social eating habits significantly affect diet, likely more so in urban areas where social eating is more common.
*   **Health Status (p = 0.012)**: The perception of health and nutritional needs also played a significant role in dietary choices.

## 4.6 Dietary Habits
Significant differences were observed in the daily eating habits of rural and urban girls:

*   **Meals per Day (p = 0.008)**: Urban girls were more likely to consume 3 or more meals per day compared to rural girls.
*   **Meal Skipping (p = 0.017)**: The prevalence of meal skipping differed significantly, with breakfast being the most frequently skipped meal.
*   **Eating Out (p < 0.001)**: Frequency of eating out was significantly higher in urban areas, contributing to the consumption of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods.
*   **Snack Preference (p < 0.001)**: A strong preference for snacks over main meals was observed, particularly in the urban population.

## 4.7 Discussion
The results of this study highlight significant disparities in the nutritional status and dietary patterns of adolescent girls in rural and urban Nigeria.

**Nutritional Status**: The significantly higher BMI in urban girls aligns with the global nutrition transition, where urbanization leads to increased sedentary behavior and consumption of calorie-dense foods. While undernutrition remains a concern in rural areas (as suggested by the "Limited Diet" cluster), the urban population is facing an emerging risk of overweight and obesity.

**Dietary Patterns**: The higher Dietary Diversity Score in urban areas suggests better micronutrient adequacy potential. However, the cluster analysis reveals that this diversity often comes with increased consumption of snacks and processed foods ("Modern/Affluent Diet"). Conversely, the rural population's lower DDS and dominance in the "Limited Diet" cluster point to a monotonous diet, likely centered on staples with limited access to nutrient-rich foods like dairy and fruits.

**Socio-Economic Influence**: The significant differences in income and parental occupation underscore the role of socio-economic status in determining food access. Higher urban income facilitates access to a diverse diet but also enables the purchase of convenience foods, as seen in the high eating-out frequency.

**Conclusion**: The study confirms a "double burden" scenario. Interventions in rural areas should focus on improving food security and diversity, while urban interventions need to address the rising consumption of unhealthy processed foods and snacks to prevent obesity.
