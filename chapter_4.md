# CHAPTER FOUR: RESULTS

## 4.1 Introduction
This chapter presents the results of the analysis of the nutritional status and dietary patterns of adolescent girls in rural and urban areas. The findings are organized into four main sections based on the specific objectives: sociodemographic status, prevalence of malnutrition, dietary intake, and factors affecting dietary habits.

## 4.2 Specific Objective 1: Sociodemographic Status
The sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents are presented in the following figures.

![Age Distribution](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/section_a_visualizations/age_distribution.png)
**Figure 1: Age Distribution of Respondents**
The age distribution shows that the majority of the respondents were in the 17-19 years age group (53.1%), followed by 14-16 years (36.2%). A similar trend was observed in both urban (55.1%) and rural (50.6%) areas.

![Religious Distribution](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/section_a_visualizations/religion.png)
**Figure 2: Religious Distribution**
The vast majority of the respondents were Christians (98.4%), with very few practicing Traditional religion (1.1%) or Islam (0.5%). This distribution was consistent across both urban and rural settings.

![Family Monthly Income](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/section_a_visualizations/family_income.png)
**Figure 3: Family Monthly Income**
There was a notable difference in family monthly income. Overall, 62.4% of families earned above 100,000 Naira. However, this was higher in urban areas (70.5%) compared to rural areas (51.9%), indicating a higher economic status among urban families.

![Guardian Education Level](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/section_a_visualizations/guardian_education.png)
**Figure 4: Guardian Education Level**
Regarding guardian education, 56.7% of guardians had tertiary education. This was more prevalent in urban areas (62.8%) compared to rural areas (48.8%), suggesting higher educational attainment among urban guardians.

## 4.3 Specific Objective 2: Prevalence of Malnutrition
The anthropometric status of the adolescents was assessed to determine the prevalence of malnutrition.

![BMI Distribution](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/section_b_visualizations/bmi_distribution.png)
**Figure 5: BMI Distribution**
The distribution of Body Mass Index (BMI) shows the spread of nutritional status among the girls. The mean BMI for the urban population was significantly higher (22.30 kg/m²) compared to the rural population (21.16 kg/m²).

![BMI Categories](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/section_b_visualizations/bmi_categories.png)
**Figure 6: BMI Categories**
The classification of BMI into categories reveals the prevalence of underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity. The chart indicates a higher tendency towards overweight and obesity in the urban area, while the rural area has a higher proportion of normal weight and underweight individuals.

![Anthropometric Measurements](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/section_b_visualizations/anthropometric_boxplots.png)
**Figure 7: Anthropometric Measurements (Boxplots)**
The boxplots provide a comparative view of weight, height, and BMI. While height was similar between the two groups (Urban: 1.58m, Rural: 1.59m), weight and BMI showed greater variation, with urban girls generally having higher values.

## 4.4 Specific Objective 3: Dietary Intake
Dietary intake was assessed using dietary diversity scores and food group consumption patterns.

![Dietary Patterns (Cluster Profiles)](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/advanced_analysis_visualizations/cluster_profiles.png)
**Figure 8: Dietary Patterns (Cluster Profiles)**
Cluster analysis identified distinct dietary patterns. Cluster 1 represents a "Modern/Affluent" diet with high consumption of snacks and dairy. Cluster 2 represents a "Limited" diet, and Cluster 3 represents a "Mixed" diet.

![Dietary Diversity Score Analysis](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/section_c_visualizations/dds_analysis.png)
**Figure 9: Dietary Diversity Score Analysis**
The Dietary Diversity Score (DDS) analysis highlights the variety of foods consumed. Urban girls had a higher mean DDS compared to rural girls, indicating a more diverse diet.

![Food Group Consumption](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/section_c_visualizations/food_group_consumption.png)
**Figure 10: Food Group Consumption**
Consumption of specific food groups varied. Urban girls had higher mean consumption scores for Snacks (3.75 vs 3.44) and Dairy (3.36 vs 2.96), while rural girls had slightly higher consumption of Tubers (3.00 vs 2.97).

## 4.5 Specific Objective 4: Factors Affecting Dietary Habits
Various factors influencing dietary habits were identified, along with specific eating behaviors.

![Cost of Food](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/section_d_visualizations/cost_of_food.png)
**Figure 11: Influence of Cost of Food**
Cost of food was a major factor, with 54.0% of respondents strongly agreeing that it affects their choices. This was more pronounced in rural areas (60.0% strongly agree) compared to urban areas (49.3%).

![Food Availability](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/section_d_visualizations/food_availability.png)
**Figure 12: Influence of Food Availability**
Food availability also played a significant role, with 68.4% strongly agreeing. Rural respondents (73.8%) felt this more strongly than urban respondents (64.3%).

![Nutritional Knowledge](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/section_d_visualizations/nutritional_knowledge.png)
**Figure 13: Influence of Nutritional Knowledge**
Nutritional knowledge influenced choices, with 38.7% agreeing and 37.9% strongly agreeing. The distribution was relatively similar across both groups.

![Peer Influence](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/section_d_visualizations/peer_influence.png)
**Figure 14: Peer Influence**
Peer influence showed mixed results. A significant portion disagreed (31.6%) or strongly disagreed (29.4%) that peers influenced their diet, though 22.9% agreed.

![Socio-Economic Status](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/section_d_visualizations/socio-economic_status.png)
**Figure 15: Influence of Socio-Economic Status**
Socio-economic status was acknowledged as a factor, with 38.4% strongly agreeing and 37.6% agreeing that it affects their dietary habits.

![Meals Per Day](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/section_e_visualizations/meals_per_day.png)
**Figure 16: Meals Per Day**
Regarding meal frequency, 42.0% of girls consumed 3 meals per day. This practice was more common in urban areas (46.9%) than in rural areas (35.6%).

![Meal Skipping](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/section_e_visualizations/meal_skipping.png)
**Figure 17: Meal Skipping**
Meal skipping was prevalent, with 51.8% of respondents reporting that they skip meals. This was higher in rural areas (58.1%) compared to urban areas (46.9%).

![Meal Type Skipped](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/section_e_visualizations/meal_type_skipped.png)
**Figure 18: Meal Type Skipped**
Breakfast was the most frequently skipped meal.

![Reasons for Skipping](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/section_e_visualizations/reasons_for_skipping.png)
**Figure 19: Reasons for Skipping Meals**
The primary reasons for skipping meals were "Not hungry" (18.0%) and "No food available" (9.5%). In rural areas, "No food available" was a more significant reason (18.1%) compared to urban areas (2.9%).

![Eating Out Frequency](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/section_e_visualizations/eating_out_frequency.png)
**Figure 20: Frequency of Eating Out**
Eating out was relatively infrequent, with 22.6% doing so "rarely". However, urban girls ate out more frequently than rural girls.

![Snack Preference](/c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Vivian%20Project/Vivian_analysis/results/section_e_visualizations/snack_preference.png)
**Figure 21: Snack Preference**
Most respondents (80.4%) stated they did not prefer snacks over main meals. However, 17.4% did prefer snacks, with a slightly higher percentage in urban areas (19.8%) compared to rural areas (14.4%).
